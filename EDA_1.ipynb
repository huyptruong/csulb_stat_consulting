    "In my opinion, there are still some \"duplicates\" left because they don't provide meaningful information. For example, the first three observations in the output above are really the same. Of course, it could be the case that the maintaners performed three separate inspections, but since no problem was found, no new information can be extracted. It's like keep checking until an event happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it's much more meaningful to compress the first three records into just one observation. For example, from 2013-09-24 - 2013-10-03, maintainer \"\\[p\\]erform\\[ed\\] an aircraft transfer or acceptance inspection\" and he/she \"\\[c\\]ompleted the inspection\". If a skeptic is still feared that information is lost, we could add a variable that counts how many time this maintenance action was repeated. (Wait, with this approach, my result would look similar to DARTe's dataset I've been working with.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this approach is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Data are compressed without losing any information.\n",
    "2. We can reduce lots of errors when joining with MSP dataset later. The MSP dataset is in GMT timezone while the the MAF dataset is in local timezone yet it doesn't specify what it is. For examle, right now it's 02:XX:XX am, Friday, 18 February, 2022 GMT*. But in Los Angeles, it's 06:XX:XX, Thursday, 17, February, 2022. So, we can see that joining on date and claiming that an error code X happened on a particular date D was given maintenance action M is not correct. On the other hand, since the date difference between any two time zone can't be more than 1 day, it'll be more accurate to say that during this period we have some amount of error code X. <font color='red'> This is a really good example of why forecasting gives more accurate results over a large period </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think the key to do this is to use `transaction_code = 11`, `malfunction_code = 0`, `action_taken_code= 0`. A challenge is that there are some missing values in `malfunction_code` and `action_taken_code` so we'll need to deal with them first.\n",
